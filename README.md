Here in the PyCity School District, we have analyzed several metrics across the school district with regards to standardized testing. The focus was on math and reading scores for a total of 39,170 students across 15 schools. 
Below is a District Summary of some of those metrics (see District_summary_fig0.JPG):
	Total Budget:			$24,649,428
	Average Math Score:		79%
	Average Reading Score:		82%
	Total Students Passing Math	75%
	Total Students Passing Reading	86%
	Overall Passing (passing both)	65%		


In Top Five_Passing Overall_fig2, we can see that 90% of students in the top five school are passing both subjects (overall passing). Additionally, the top five schools are all charter schools with spending ranges per student roughly less than $640/ per student. Which is in the bottom tier of our third bin. (See Spending_Summary-bin_fig3).

In Spending_Summary-bin_fig3, we can conclude that more spending per student did not show an increase in the percentage of overall passing students. 

Finally, when we looked at the performance based on school size. Medium sized schools, with a student count of between 1000-2000 performed slightly better than small schools with less than 1000 students at 90% and 91% respectively.  While large sized schools with more than 2000 students performed overall poorly with 42% of students falling both subjects.
